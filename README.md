# üåê audit-a11y

audit-a11y is a command line tool for auditing web pages for accessibility concerns.

## üí° why?

recently on shhhbb.com bbs there was a person who related their story with impending disability that was already affecting their accessibility capabilities. this program was an idea that came from that conversation.

## üöÄ usage

to use audit-a11y you can clone it from github and build it yourself, or download a release and run it right away like this:

```
./audit-a11y example.com
```

```
./audit-ally https://github.com

for each infraction, the infraction itself and a multiplier denoting the number of occurrences will be included. 

## ü§ù contributing

if you want to help out this project, great, i'd love to hear your ideas. also, thank you :)

some todo items that make sense to add are:

- printing the offending html lines under each infraction category
- count the lines seen vs the lines scanned
- include an MDN link for each infraction type for more information on fixing it
- spider mode, integrate `donuts-are-good/araknnid` to crawl everything on a specific domain and prepare a report for each page found in that domain.
  - requires using araknnid with `--depth` to narrow the scope, may need to whitelist rather than blacklist
- add more checks
- add unit tests for existing checks
